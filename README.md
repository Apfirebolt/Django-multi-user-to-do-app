# A Multi-user To Do Application in Django using React and Bootstrap

A multi user based to do app in Django using React and Bootstrap. It has the ability to create tasks segregated by category
and has full CRUD functionality on both categories and tasks. It is being given a make-over by having a separate front-end written in React.

All the forms are now replaced by serializers, Multi-page architecture of the application is now changed into single page application using React having to render a single Html page with all assets. 

## Getting Started

Create a new virtual environment as a best practice norm. Install python packages through pip using the bundled requirements
file. This project used Django version 2.2 but that has been updated recently to Django 4 (May - 2022), so just in case you wanted to know. For the database it uses Postgres. Some of the features of this application are written below :-

* You can start by registering through the custom user login system built in Django.
